I'm a final-year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. I'm an incoming PhD student from [Department of ECE](https://ece.princeton.edu/), Princeton University, starting Fall 2024. My research interest spans broadly in hardware design, VLSI circuits and systems.

I was advised by Prof. Xiyuan Tang of [PRIME Lab](https://tangresearch.top/index.html), Peking University, focusing on sensor interface design. During Summer 2023 and Fall 2023, I was fortunated to visit the fascinating campus of the University of Michigan, and conducted research on transmitter circuit for satellite localization under the guidance of [Prof. David Blaauw](https://blaauw.engin.umich.edu/).

I enjoy playing basketball, guitar, music games, jogging, etc., for relaxation. Please feel free to reach out for discussing research or just making friends!
