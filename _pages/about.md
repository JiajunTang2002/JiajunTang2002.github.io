I received my Bachelor of Science from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, in July 2024. I am a first-year PhD student from [Department of ECE](https://ece.princeton.edu/), Princeton University, starting August 2024. My research interest spans broadly in integrated circuits, advanced wireless communication and AI.

I was advised by Prof. Xiyuan Tang of [PRIME Lab](https://tangresearch.top/index.html), Peking University, focusing on integrated circuit design for energy-efficient sensing. During Summer 2023 and Fall 2023, I was fortunate to visit the fascinating campus of the University of Michigan, and conducted research on transmitter circuit and algorithm for satellite localization under the guidance of [Prof. David Blaauw](https://blaauw.engin.umich.edu/).

I enjoy playing basketball, guitar, music games, jogging, etc., for relaxation. Please feel free to reach out for discussing research or just making friends!
