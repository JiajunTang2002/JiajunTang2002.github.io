I received my Bachelor of Science from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, in July 2024. I am currently a PhD student from [Department of ECE](https://ece.princeton.edu/), Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Kaushik Sengupta](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/kaushik-sengupta). My research interest spans broadly in design methodology in RF and analog integrated circuits and AI-aided circuit design.

From 2023 to 2024, I was advised by [Prof. Xiyuan Tang](https://tangresearch.top/people/index.html) at Peking University, focusing on integrated circuit design for energy-efficient sensing. During Summer 2023 and Fall 2023, I was fortunate to visit the University of Michigan, and conducted research on satellite localization under the guidance of [Prof. David Blaauw](https://blaauw.engin.umich.edu/).

My hobbies include playing the guitar, basketball, photography, bodyfitting, etc. I enjoy meeting people from diverse backgrounds and am always open to coffee chats at Princeton. To reach out, please send me an [email](mailto: jt1488@princeton.edu).
